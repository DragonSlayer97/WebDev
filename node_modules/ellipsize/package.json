It's not rocket science, but something as simple as this you should\nwrite in five minutes right? Never mind the unit test.\n\nThis ellipsize function is robust and tested against a couple of edge cases.\nIt's written to be fast, work in any browser and have no dependencies at all.\n\nIt simply loops over all the characters using a single function call, storing the\nlast location of an allowed break point, if any. Otherwise it just truncates the string\nor return empty string if `truncate` options set up to `false` (in some cases its just better).\n\n## Examples\n\n```javascript\n\n    var ellipsize = require('ellipsize');\n\n    ellipsize('');\n    // ''\n    ellipsize(undefined);\n    // ''\n    ellipsize('one two three four', 8 );\n    // 'one two…'\n    ellipsize('one two-three four', 8 );\n    // 'one two…'\n    ellipsize('one two three four', 100 );\n    // 'one two three four'\n    ellipsize('12345678910')\n    // '1234567…'\n    ellipsize('abc', 0 );\n    // ''\n\n```\nYou may provide an alternative ellipse character, or \"break points\" like so:\n\n```javascript\n    var ellipsize = require('ellipsize');\n\n    ellipsize( 'one two&three four', 8, { chars: [' ', '&'], ellipse: '→' });\n    // 'one two→'\n\n```\n\nAlso you may provide a setting to `truncate` words:\n\n```javascript\n    var ellipsize = require('ellipsize');\n\n    ellipsize( '123456789ABCDEF', 8, { truncate: false });\n    // '' \n\n    // its default settings\n    ellipsize( '123456789ABCDEF', 8, { truncate: true });\n    // '1234567…'\n\n```\n\n## Copyright\n\nThe MIT License (MIT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2014 Matthijs van Henten\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
